# Machine Learning toy project (Classification)

In this project, we build four different machine learning classification algorithms to predict wheter or not a company will go bankrupt given some predictor variable. 
The models are K-nearest neighbors, Neural network, Logistic regression and Linear discriminant analysis. Comparative analysis is made by using a 10-fold cross validation in 
order to identify the model that is better suited for predicting economic bankruptcy of companies given the predictors.
